# T8 - Libraries and organizing work in Clojure
A small exercise with Namespaces.

* Create a file where you create your own namespace. 
* Let the namespace use all definitions from clojure.core. 
* Write a function that would list all the definitions available to you at this moment.
* Define one function in your created namespace that will be available only in your namespace, i.e. private.
